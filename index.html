                        novel world
                        where Wolves and Sheep could play with a goddess of luck named Fortuna. Degens from across the
                        metaverse flocked to compete for tantalizing riches of $WOOL, $GEMS and untold fame. Those brave
                        souls who successfully courted the fickle goddess quickly climbed, and It became clear that
                        those who won the $WOOL would rule All.

                        harmony. The Shepherd had laid forth a clear world order of production, taxation, and
                        reproduction. However, many a wolf and sheep would soon learn that any journey to a new land of
                        high stakes and high rewards was bound to be filled with many twists and turns. In the chaos of
                        that innovation, wolves and sheep alike began to realize it would take frens to survive and
                        thrive.

                        lone wolves were compelled to a massive round tree stump deep in the woods below. On that night

                                    Decisions get made from the bottom-up, governed by a community organized

                                    Wolf Guild recruited a team of people that are well known experts in

                                    its
                                    related systems. With this team we will strive to always have the
                                    perfect strategy
                                    and
                                    will
                                    perform better than any other pack in Wolf.Game as well as other P2E
                                    ecosystems.
                                    This
                                    includes not only the strategy but also finances, communication and all
                                    other
                                    important
                                    arenas. Furthermore, we want to emphasize that the DAO gives small
                                    players a voice.
                                    Community individuals will get voted into a position of GAME MOD to
                                    collect the best
                                    ideas
                                    from the community and translate that into proposals/votes and then into
                                    action. It
                                    will
                                    also be fun.

                                    Wolf.Game is a risk protocol for NFTs with novel tokenomics. It shows

                                    interactions between the ERC-20 and ERC-721 protocols. For the very
                                    first time, your
                                    NFT
                                    can
                                    steal other NFTs (ERC-721 tokens) for you. The rarer your NFT, the more
                                    tokens
                                    you'll
                                    accumulate probabilistically. Wolf.Game is pioneering new types of NFT
                                    mechanics.
